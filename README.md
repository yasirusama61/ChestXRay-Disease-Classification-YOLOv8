## 📊 Class Distribution in Train, Validation, and Test Sets

![Class Distribution](images/class_distribution.png)  

The bar chart above represents the distribution of images across different classes in the training, validation, and test datasets. This helps in understanding class imbalance and dataset composition:

- **Train (Blue)**: Majority of images are allocated to training to allow the model to learn effectively.
- **Validation (Orange)**: A smaller set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor overfitting.
- **Test (Green)**: A separate set for evaluating the final model performance.

This visualization ensures that all 11 classes are well represented across all splits and helps in improving model generalization.

## 📈 Training Metrics and Loss Curves

The following plots represent the training loss curves, classification loss, and performance metrics during the training process:

![Training Metrics](images/results.png)

## 📉 Loss Curve Analysis

The training and validation loss curves provide insights into the model's learning process.

### 🔍 Observations:
- **Train Loss:** Gradually decreases, showing stable learning.
- **Validation Loss:** Initially drops but plateaus, indicating limited further learning.
- **Precision & Recall:** Precision increases over epochs but fluctuates, while recall stabilizes between **0.5 - 0.7**.
- **mAP Scores:** Consistently improving, confirming better predictions.

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
- **Validation loss plateauing** → Model may require fine-tuning (learning rate decay, weight decay).
- **Fluctuations in precision & recall** → Some classes might be harder to classify due to **imbalance**.
- **Slight Drop in Top-1 Accuracy** compared to previous runs.

### 🔧 Recommendations:
1. **Use Cosine Learning Rate Decay** (`cos_lr=True`) to improve convergence.
2. **Enhance Data Augmentation** to handle class imbalance.
3. **Increase Dropout Regularization** (`dropout=0.3`) to prevent overfitting.
4. **Try a Larger Model** (`YOLOv8m-cls`) for better feature extraction.

🚀 *Next Step:* Re-run training with adjustments & monitor validation loss trends.

### 🎯 **Final Model Performance**
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: **62.5%**
- **Top-5 Accuracy**: **91.0%**
- **Test Set Size**: **542 images**
- **Total Classes**: **11**

## 🛠 Solving Multi-Label Per Image Classification in YOLO  

### **🚀 The Problem**  
YOLO is originally designed for **single-class object detection**, meaning each detected object (bounding box) is assigned only **one label**. However, in **medical imaging**, an X-ray or MRI can contain **multiple conditions simultaneously**.  

#### **🛑 Issues Encountered:**
- Training YOLO as a **classification model** (subfolder-based approach) resulted in **poor performance**, the top 1 accuracy is just 60%.
- Directly using **YOLO detection** led to **low precision** due to **incorrect class assignments**.
- **No built-in support for multi-label classification** per image.

---

### **✅ Our Solution: Treating Multi-Label Classification as Object Detection**
Since YOLO expects **object detection annotations**, we **tricked YOLO into multi-label learning** by:
1. **Using a bounding box that covers the entire image** for each label.
2. **Allowing multiple bounding boxes (one per disease) per image**.
3. **Training YOLO in detection mode** instead of classification mode.

**📌 Example YOLO Annotation (`image.txt`) for an X-ray with "Effusion" and "Atelectasis":**
```txt
7 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0  # Effusion (Class 7)
8 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0  # Atelectasis (Class 8)
```

- **Hybrid Approach:** Combine YOLO for detection with **ResNet/EfficientNet for classification**.
- **Data Augmentation:** Experiment with **mixup augmentation** to improve generalization.

## 📊 Class-Conditional Augmentation for Imbalanced YOLO Multilabel Dataset

The ChestXDet10 dataset contains strong class imbalance across multiple disease labels. To address this, we implemented **class-conditional augmentation** during YOLO format preprocessing to improve model generalization, especially on underrepresented classes.

### ✅ What We Did

- Calculated the number of training images per class label.
- Set a **target image count** (`2000 per class`) to balance minority classes.
- Identified underrepresented classes and selected images containing them.
- Applied **Albumentations-based augmentations** to those images:
  - Horizontal flips
  - Random brightness & contrast
  - Small-angle rotation
  - CLAHE (contrast enhancement for medical images)
- Saved the **augmented images** and generated corresponding YOLO label files.
  - Each label kept a full-image bounding box: `class_id 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0`

### 📁 Output

Augmented images and `.txt` label files are saved directly into the `train/images` and `train/labels` directories inside the YOLO dataset structure.

This ensures class distribution is much more balanced before training, resulting in better recall and overall performance on rare pathologies.

The following log shows how many synthetic samples were needed for some of the underrepresented classes:

![Augmentation Log](images/augment_log.png)

## 🧪 Targeted Class-Conditional Augmentation (Minority-Only Strategy)

To address severe class imbalance in the ChestXDet10 dataset, we implemented a **targeted augmentation strategy** that applies strong data augmentation only to a selected set of **minority classes**.

### 🔍 Strategy Overview

- **Minority Classes Augmented**:  
  `Pneumothorax (1)`, `Emphysema (2)`, `Calcification (3)`, `Nodule (4)`, `Mass (5)`, `Fracture (6)`, `Atelectasis (8)`, `Fibrosis (9)`
  
- **Majority Classes Skipped**:  
  `Consolidation (0)`, `Effusion (7)`, and `No Finding (10)` were not augmented to prevent over-representation.

- **Augmentation Techniques Used**:
  - `Rotation` (±30°)
  - `Horizontal` and `Vertical Flip`
  - `Random Brightness/Contrast`
  - `Gaussian Blur`
  - `Random Scale`
  - `Coarse Dropout` (simulating occlusion)
